## Welcome to codeConnects!

To get started from your command line:

-  Clone this repository: git clone git@github.com:the-coding-school/codeConnects.git
-  cd codeConnects
-  npm install
-  npm start

This should install all dependencies and start the project at localhost:3000 for you.

It will likely fail unless you have also done the following:

1. Email/Slack message Abhi for your Dynamodb Access Keys
2. Replace the dummy keys with them in the file config/credentials.json

!!! - Please never add/commit the credentials.json file to any of the remote branches

If you are backend and find that you're unfamiliar with any of the technologies in our stack, please look up some tutorials and read documentation for them (dynamodb, express, node).

If you are part of the front end team, look to Andy for more specific direction on what
you should be learning.

Good Luck and Welcome to the Team~
