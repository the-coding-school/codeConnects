# CodeConnects Front End

## Running the application

Added npm scripts to be used when building!
Run npm install in the main directory, and then 'npm run dev' to get a current image
of the react application. Its pretty bad rn, but hopefully we all will be pushing
it to some great heights!

## App planning

Currently using...

React
Webpack --> Dealing with a lot of the stuff I dont want to do
  css-loader --> Bundling our css for us
  file-loader --> Similar for assets
Babel --> Transpiling so we can use modern JavaScript yay

Currently using npm still --> Do we want to use yarn or gulp or something of that
variety?

#TODO
 Setup eslint --> we need some linting
 Setup gulpfile or grunt, or some sort of command line helper for automation of tasks
   Build automation / test automation --> Go pipeline
 Decide on a test framework! --> WE NEED TESTS
 Componentize/Modularize application
 Data handling? Redux? --> Maybe too much for what we are building...
